# Overview

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

metricpulling reads data from a DEFRA Biodiversity Net Gain metric xlsx file and
does the following actions:

- runs a series of checks for errors or missing data
- creates summaries of baseline and proposed data for all habitat modules (habitat, hedge, watercourse)
- creates sumamries of net units for each habitat module
- creates summaries of the trading rules

These summaries can be used in creating reports on BNG projects.

## Installation

The package can be installed from Digital Ecologyâ€™s Codeberg repository:

``` r
remotes::install_git("https://codeberg.org/Digital-Ecology/metric_pulling.git")
```

## Examples

To run the metric checks:

```{r metric-check-example}
library(metricpulling)

metric <- system.file("extdata", "OnSiteBoth.xlsx", package = "metricpulling")

metric_check(metric)

```

To return a data summary for baseline habitats:

```{r habitat-summary-example}

pullonsitehabitatbaseline(metric)

```
