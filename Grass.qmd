3.sectionNumber.1 Grasslands were surveyed using a systematic approach, using 1x1m\^2 quadrats sample. A minimum of three quadrats were undertaken of each grassland section. However, this can be increased to take into account variation across the grassland or the extent of the field. Information collected within each quadrat included aspect, slope, average ground cover, sward variation, species, and their percentage cover.

3.sectionNumber.2 Where the grassland differed to a certain extent or was divided by field boundary such as hedgerows it was considered that the grassland was a different habitat parcel, and another assessment was undertaken.

3.sectionNumber.3 This survey methodology provides information required to classify the grassland to the correct grassland habitat type and provides sufficient information to undertake a condition assessment.
